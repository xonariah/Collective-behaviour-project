# Collective Animal Behavior Project

### Team Members:
- Ariana Kržan (GitHub: @xonariah)
- Tina Brdnik (GitHub: )

### Starting Point:
We are building our project on the paper *"Predator–prey survival pressure is sufficient to evolve swarming behaviors"* by Jianan Li et al. (2023), which models how simple survival pressures in predator-prey dynamics can lead to the evolution of complex swarming behaviors in prey, such as flocking and swirling. In addition, we are incorporating insights from the paper *"Predator confusion is sufficient to evolve swarming behavior"* by Olson et al. (2013), which focuses on how predator confusion can serve as a selective pressure driving prey to evolve swarming behaviors as a defense mechanism. Together, these papers will form the foundation for our exploration of predator-prey interactions and the evolution of collective animal behavior.


### Project Plan:
- **Kick-off (Oct 26, 2024):** Create the GitHub repository, identify starting research paper, and outline the project plan.
- **First Report (Nov 16, 2024):** Provide an overview of the swarming behavior models, review relevant literature, and draft a proposal for the methodology we will use to test our hypothesis.
- **Second Report (Dec 7, 2024):** Refine our methodology based on feedback from the first report, and implement the model to collect preliminary results.
- **Final Report (Jan 11, 2025):** Present a fully polished version of our findings, along with the final model results and conclusions.

### Milestones:
- [ ] **Kick-off:** Repository setup and project plan (Due: Oct 26, 2024)
- [ ] **First Report:** Literature review and methodology proposal (Due: Nov 16, 2024)
- [ ] **Second Report:** Refined methodology and preliminary results (Due: Dec 7, 2024)
- [ ] **Final Report:** Final results and conclusions (Due: Jan 11, 2025)

Throughout the course, we will regularly update this README.md file to track our progress and adjust our plan as necessary.
