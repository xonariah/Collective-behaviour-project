### Starting Point:
We are building our project on the paper *["Predator–prey survival pressure is sufficient to evolve swarming behaviors"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/acf33a)* by Jianan Li et al. (2023), which models how simple survival pressures in predator-prey dynamics can lead to the evolution of complex swarming behaviors in prey, such as flocking and swirling. In addition, we are incorporating insights from the paper *["Predator confusion is sufficient to evolve swarming behavior"](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2013.0305)* by Olson et al. (2013), which focuses on how predator confusion can serve as a selective pressure driving prey to evolve swarming behaviors as a defense mechanism. The goal of this project is to create a realistic simulation that reflects the natural evolution of swarming behavior under survival pressure from predators. We would use reinforcement learning, for the animals (agents) to learn. The idea of "survival pressure" (prey trying to avoid being eaten, predators trying to catch them) leads to new behaviors. We would observe the swarming and flocking behaviors in prey and new hunting strategies in predators. The expansion on the paper would be introducing a new species to investigate potential emergent behaviors that could arise from interspecies interactions and also new environment variables such as obstacles that adds more realism to the simulation.

### Project Plan and Milestones:
- **[Kick-Off](https://github.com/xonariah/Collective-behaviour-project/milestone/1)
 (Oct 26, 2024):** Create the GitHub repository, identify starting research paper, and outline the project plan.
- **[First Report](https://github.com/xonariah/Collective-behaviour-project/milestone/2) (Nov 16, 2024):** Provide an overview of the swarming behavior models, review relevant literature, and draft a proposal for the methodology we will use to test our hypothesis.
- **[Second Report](https://github.com/xonariah/Collective-behaviour-project/milestone/3) (Dec 7, 2024):** Refine our methodology based on feedback from the first report, and implement the model to collect preliminary results.
- **[Final Report](https://github.com/xonariah/Collective-behaviour-project/milestone/4) (Jan 11, 2025):** Present a fully polished version of our findings, along with the final model results and conclusions.
